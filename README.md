# Emoji-Prediction-using-Tranfer-Learning-NLP

Emojis are the incredible way of expressing yourself.Therefore, our machines should also be aware of the appropriate emoji to be used at the right time. Thus, this project does the same.
In this project, the model is predicting emoji's according to a given sentence using Deep Learning Models.

The following steps are mainly involved :
1. Working with "Emoji" package.
2. Processing the custom emoji dataset
3. Glove vectors
4. Glove embeddings
5. Creating a LSTM architecture
6. Training a stacked LSTM
